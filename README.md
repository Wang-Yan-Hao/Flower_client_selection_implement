# Flower other algorithm and client_selection implement
We implement below functions in [flower](https://flower.dev/docs/), a federal learning framework. All the examples use Pytorch, but it can easily extend to another ML framework due to flower attributes.

1. Client selection, Server can choose the Client they want (by the client RAM or Data_size...) to do FL.
2. FedProx
3. FedCurv
